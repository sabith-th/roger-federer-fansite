        <h2>List of Career Achievements of Roger Federer</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Roger Federer is considered by some sports analysts, media pundits, fellow players and fans around the world as the greatest tennis player of all time.</p>
        <p>Federer has won an all-time record 17 Grand Slam singles titles and has reached a record 27 Grand Slam finals, 23 consecutive semi-final appearances and 36 consecutive quarter final appearances. He is one of seven men to have won a career Grand Slam (winning all four Grand Slams at least once) and one of three players to have won a career Grand Slam on three different surfaces (hard, grass & clay). Federer has won 7 Wimbledon titles which is a joint all-time record with William Renshaw and Pete Sampras. He is the only player to reach 10 Wimbledon finals, which is an all-time record in men's tennis. He is one of three players to win two different Grand Slams at least 5 times (Wimbledon and US Open) and is the only player to win two Grand Slams five consecutive times at Wimbledon from 2003-07 and the US Open from 2003-08. Roger Federer has spent 302 weeks as the number 1 ranked player in the world (ranked 237 weeks as number 1 consecutively), the most of any men's tennis player in the open era and all time.</p>

        <p>Roger Federer has won an all-time record 9 hard court Grand Slam titles and is the only player to achieve such a feat in the open era. He is the only player to win 5 consecutive titles at the US Open (2004-08). Federer is considered the most consistent player of all time, he reached an all-time record of ten consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005-07, 23 consecutive semi-finals and 36 consecutive quarter finals in the Grand Slams. The only player to rival Federer's consistency is Novak Djokovic. Furthermore, Federer has won an all-time record of 60 hard court titles and has reached an all-time record of 42 Masters 1000 finals. Federer has won an all-time record 7 Cincinnati Masters 1000 titles and he is a perfect 7-0 when reaching the finals. He has also won an all-time record 7 Swiss Indoors titles and has reached the final at the Swiss Indoors for a total of 12 years (2000-01, 2006-15) and consecutive 10 years (2006-15) and is the only player to ever achieve both feats in the open era. Federer has also registered a 56 match win streak on hard courts which is the most in the open era.</p>
        <p>Federer's success does not hold strictly to hard courts, his most successful surface is grass where he has won an all-time record 15 grass court titles including an all-time record 8 Halle Open titles and a joint open era record of 7 Wimbledon titles (five of which he won consecutively from 2003-07), he reached an all-time record 7 consecutive Wimbledon finals from 2003-09 and is the only player to achieve this feat in the open era as well as reaching a record 10 Wimbledon finals (the most of any player in the pre open era and the open era). Federer has the longest grass court winning streak in the open era as he registered a 65 match win streak on grass from 2003 to 2008 where he was beaten by Rafael Nadal in the 2008 Wimbledon final. Due to his success on grass courts, Federer is widely viewed as the greatest grass court player of all time having surpassed the likes of Pete Sampras (winner of 7 Wimbledon trophies and undefeated in finals), Bjorn Borg (won 5 consecutive Wimbledon finals), Boris Becker, John McEnroe, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal due to his consistent record on grass and the number of titles/finals he has accrued.</p>
        <p>Alongside his record on grass, Federer was an exceptional player on clay courts, he has reached 5 French Open finals only being beaten by Rafael Nadal who is classed by many as the greatest clay court player ever. Federer won his first and only French Open title in 2009 when he also won Wimbledon thus achieving the "Channel Slam" alongside Borg and Nadal. Federer has won 11 clay court titles and 6 clay court masters 1000 titles. His consistency in his prime years on clay was rivaled only by Rafael Nadal and Federer is widely viewed as the second greatest clay court player during Nadal's era in the French Open from 2005-11 when he reached 1 semi final, 1 quarter final, 5 final appearances and 1 French open win.</p>
        <p>Federer is the only player to register at least ten titles on three different surfaces, he has won an all-time record of 60 hard court titles, record 15 grass court titles and 11 clay court titles and is the only player to achieve such a feat. In his prime years, he won multiple Grand Slams between 2004-07 when he won an unparalleled 11 Grand Slams (3 Australian Open titles, 4 Wimbledon titles and 4 US Open titles). He reached finals of all four Grand Slams for three years in 2006-07 and 2009 and is the only player to have reached all four finals in one season multiple times. In the World Tour Finals, Federer has won an open era record 6 titles at the prestigious eight men tournament and has qualified at the tournament 14 consecutive times, both records as well as reaching an all-time record of 10 finals.</p>
