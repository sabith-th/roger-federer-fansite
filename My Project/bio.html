        <hr>
        <p>In 2003, he established the Roger Federer Foundation to help disadvantaged children and to promote their access to education and sports.
         Since May 2004, citing his close ties with South Africa including because that is where his mother was raised,
          he started supporting the South Africa-Swiss charity IMBEWU which helps children better connect to sports and social
           and health awareness and, in 2005,
          Federer visited South Africa to meet the children that had benefited from his support.
           In 2005, he auctioned his racquet from his US Open championship to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina.
           At the 2005 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Federer arranged an exhibition involving several top players from the ATP and WTA tour called Rally for Relief.
           The proceeds went to the victims of the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.
           He was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador by UNICEF in April 2006 and has appeared in UNICEF public messages to raise public awareness of AIDS.
           In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, he arranged a collaboration with fellow top tennis players for a special charity event during the 2010 Australian Open called 'Hit for Haiti', in which proceeds went to Haiti earthquake victims.
           He participated in a follow-up charity exhibition during the 2010 Indian Wells Masters which raised $1 million.
           The Nadal vs Federer "Match for Africa" in 2010 in Zurich and Madrid raised more than $4 million for the Roger Federer Foundation and Fundaci√≥n Rafa Nadal.
