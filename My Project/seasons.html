            <h3>Pre-1998 : Junior years</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Federer's main accomplishments as a junior player came at Wimbledon in 1998,
              where he won both the boys' singles final over Irakli Labadze, and in doubles teamed with Olivier Rochus,
              defeating the team of Michael Llodra and Andy Ram. In addition, Federer lost the US Open Junior final in 1998 to David Nalbandian.
              He won four ITF junior singles tournaments in his career, including the prestigious Orange Bowl,
              where he defeated Guillermo Coria in the final. He ended 1998 with the no. 1 junior world ranking, and
              he entered his first tournament as a professional during 1998 in Gstaad, where he lost to Lucas Arnold Ker in the first round.
            </p>
            <h3>1998-2002 : Early career and breakthrough in the ATP</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Federer entered the top 100 ranking for the first time on 20 September 1999. His first final came at the Marseille Open in 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset.
              Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with Martina Hingis.
              The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals.
              Federer's first singles win was at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter in the final.
              Although he won his first title already in 1999 on the Challenger tour, winning the doubles event in Segovia, Spain with Dutchman Sander Groen, the final was played on Federer's 18th birthday.
              In 2001, Federer made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, and at Wimbledon that same year defeated four-time defending champion Pete Sampras to reach the quarterfinals.
              The most prestigious event final he reached during this period was the 2002 Miami Masters event, where he lost to Andre Agassi on hard court.
            </p>
            <p>
              Federer won his first Master Series event at the 2002 Hamburg Masters on clay, over Marat Safin; the victory put him in top 10 for the first time.
              Federer made 10 singles finals between 1998 and 2002, of which he won four and lost six.  He also made six finals in doubles.
              Of note are Federer and partner Max Mirnyi's defeat in the final of the Indian Wells Masters in 2002, and their victory in the same year in the final of the Rotterdam 500 series event.
              Federer had won the latter a year earlier with partner Jonas Bjorkman. He finished 2001 with an ATP ranking of no. 13, and 2002 was the first year he was ranked within the top 10,finishing at no.6.

            <h3>2003 : Wimbledon Breakthrough</h3>
            <hr>
            <div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left:0px">
            <p>Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam title in the 2003 Wimbledon Championships, which he won it over Mark Philippoussis, 7-6(5), 6-2, 7-6(3).
              Federer won his first and only doubles Masters Series 1000 Event in Miami with Max Mirnyi, and made it to one singles Masters Series 1000 final in Rome on clay, which he lost.
              Federer made it to nine finals on the ATP Tour, of which he won seven, including the 500 series events at Dubai and Vienna.
              Lastly, Federer won the Year-End Championships over Andre Agassi.
            </p>
            <p>Federer entered Wimbledon as the fourth seed and quickly raced through the first three rounds.
              In the fourth round he faced Feliciano LÃ³pez and was victorious in straight sets even though he had to take numerous injury timeouts for a serious lower back injury sustained in the match warm-up.
              In the quarterfinals Federer was fortunate that the match was delayed because of rain and was able to rest his injury for two whole days.
              When the quarterfinals finally began Federer defeated the eighth seed Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands. His next match was a blockbuster semifinal where he faced American favorite Andy Roddick.
              Roddick had won the other grass court tuneup at the Queen's Club Championships and was an extremely dangerous opponent on grass.
              Federer defeated his young American rival 7-6(6), 6-3, 6-3 and became the first Swiss man to advance to the finals of a Grand Slam tournament. In the finals Federer faced Australian Philippoussis who had defeated him earlier in the year at Hamburg.
              Federer, however, proved that he possessed the quality of a champion and rose to the occasion.
              As Philippoussis's backhand sailed into the net on championship point Federer sank to his knees, raised his arms above his head, and looked to the sky.
              He had defeated the Australian 7-6(5), 6-2, 7-6(3) and finally achieved his elusive first Grand Slam title.

              <p>His breakthrough and victory and the 2003 Wimbledon Championships proved especially significant because Federer would go on to win more Grand Slam titles than any man in tennis history.
                This achievement of winning his first ever Wimbledon and Grand Slam title has been repeatedly described by the Swiss star as the highlight of his career along with his 2009 victory at Roland Garros.
              </p>
              <p>To end the year, Federer won his first Tennis Masters Cup title in Houston. As the third-seeded player, he defeated Andre Agassi to open the round robin in a thrilling 6-7(2), 6-3, 7-6(7) epic.
                He would go on to straight set Nalbandian 6-3, 6-0, defeating the Argentine for the first time in his career.
                His last round robin match was against world number 2 Juan Carlos Ferrero who fell to Federer 6-3, 6-1.
                In the semifinals he defeated world number 1 and US Open champion Andy Roddick 7-6, 6-2.
                Federer entered the final against the 1990 champion Andre Agassi and won decisively 6-3, 6-0, 6-4.
              </p>
              <p>Federer challenged for the top ranking during 2003, finishing the year at world number 2,
                just behind Roddick and just ahead of Juan Carlos Ferrero.

            <hr>
            <div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left:0px">
            <p>Roger Federer won three Grand Slams in 2004 for the first time in his career.
              The first came at the Australian Open over Marat Safin, 7-6(3), 6-4, 6-2.
              He went on to win his second Wimbledon crown over Andy Roddick, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6(3), 6-4.
              In addition, Federer defeated the 2001 US Open Champion Lleyton Hewitt at the US Open for his first US Open title, 6-0, 7-6(3), 6-0.
              Furthermore, Federer won three ATP Masters 1000 events, one on clay at Hamburg, and two on hard court in Indian Wells and Canada.
              Federer took the ATP 500 series event at Dubai, and wrapped up the year for the second time over Lleyton Hewitt at the Tennis Masters Cup.
              Federer was the first player to win three Grand Slams in a single season since Mats Wilander in 1988.
            </p>
            <p>Federer became the first man in the Open Era to win at least three Grand Slams and the Year-End Championships.
            As of 2015, Federer and Novak Djokovic are the only male tennis players to accomplish this, with Federer repeating
            the feat in 2006 and 2007 and Djokovic doing so in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>In 2004, Federer had one of the most dominating and successful years in the open era of modern men's tennis.
              He won three of the four Grand Slam singles tournaments, did not lose a match to anyone ranked in the top 10,
              won every final he reached, and was named the ITF Tennis World Champion.
              His win-loss record for the year was 74-6 with 11 titles, which included three of the year's four Grand Slams and three ATP Masters Series titles.

              <h4>The Grandslams and Masters Cup</h4>
              <hr>
            <p>Federer entered the 2004 Australian Open as the second seed behind American Andy Roddick.
              In the fourth round he rallied to defeat former number one and native son Lleyton Hewitt after dropping the first set.
              His nemesis David Nalbandian, who had won five of their six previous meetings, awaited him in the quarterfinals.
              Federer managed to dispatch the Argentine in four tight sets.
              The semifinals proved easier as Federer crunched world no. 3 Juan Carlos Ferrero and reached his first Australian Open final.
              His opponent in the final was former world no. 1 and 2000 US Open champion Marat Safin.
              After winning the opening set in a tiebreaker Federer secured a 7-6, 6-4, 6-2 championship win.
              This victory delivered him his first Australian Open and his second career Grand Slam.
              This win also saw him supplant Roddick as the world no. 1 on 2 February 2004, a ranking he would hold for an all-time record 237 consecutive weeks until 18 August 2008.
            </p>
            <p>After his victory in the grass tuneup at Halle, Federer entered the Wimbledon Championships as the defending champion.
              Federer was aiming to be the first man to defend his title at Wimbledon since Pete Sampras (1999-2000).
              The Swiss dropped only one set as he made his way through the tournament and reached the final.
              He played world number 2 Andy Roddick for the championship in a thrilling four set final.
              Roddick came out strong with incredible serving and took the first set.
              The second set began with Federer racing out to a 4-0 lead, but Roddick rallied to level it at 4-4.
              Federer ultimately broke Roddick in the twelfth game and leveled the match at one set a piece.
              The pivotal third set was decided by a tiebreaker which was won by the Swiss defending champion.
              Federer closed out the match in four sets to win his third career Grand Slam.
            </p>
            <p>Federer entered the 2004 US Open as the top seed looking to win his first US Open championship.
              Federer cruised through the first four rounds before facing Andre Agassi in the quarterfinals.
              His match against the two time US Open champion proved to be a thrilling five set epic.
              After splitting the first two sets the third set went to 5-5 before Federer broke and took a two set to one advantage.
              Agassi would take the fourth but Federer claimed the fifth and decisive set.
              In the semifinals Federer eased past former nemesis Tim Henman in straight sets.
              Federer won his first US Open singles title, defeating Lleyton Hewitt, 6-0, 7-6(3), 6-0, in the final.
              This was one of the most dominant displays in US Open history as Federer was the first player to win two bagel sets in the final since 1884.
            </p>
            <p>He returned after six weeks out of action at the Tennis Masters Cup in Houston.
              Federer was honored as the top seed by having lunch with former President George H.W. Bush.
              He was the defending champion at the Year-End Championships and was placed during the round robin stage in the Red Group.
              The Red Group consisted of former no. 1 players Carlos MoyÃ¡ and Lleyton Hewitt as well as reigning French Open champion Gaston Gaudio.
              He won all three round robin matches, taking six of seven sets, and faced Marat Safin in the semifinals.
              Federer won the first set, but the second set turned into a historic marathon tiebreaker.
              The tiebreaker was won by Federer by a score of 20-18 and lasted 27 minutes.
              The 38 points equalled the longest tie-break in tennis history along with Borg-Lall at 1973 Wimbledon and Ivanisevic-Nestor at 1993 US Open.
              Federer next faced Lleyton Hewitt in the finals for the sixth time that season and won the championship match 6-3, 6-2.
              This victory was his thirteenth consecutive victory in a tournament final which broke the record he had shared with Borg and McEnroe.

              <h3>2005 : Consolidating Dominance</h3>
              <hr>
              <div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left:0px">
                <p>Roger Federer made two Grand Slam finals in 2005, winning both at Wimbledon over Andy Roddick, 6-2, 7-6(2), 6-4, and then defeating Andre Agassi in his last Grand Slam final at the US Open, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6(1), 6-1. However, Federer failed to make the final at the other two Majors, losing in the semifinals of the Australian Open to Marat Safin and the French Open to Rafael Nadal. However, Federer won four ATP Masters Series 1000 at Indian Wells, Miami, and Cincinnati on hard courts and one lone clay court title at Hamburg. Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai. Federer lost the Year-End Championships to David Nalbandian in the final.</p>
                <p>The season was statistically one of the most dominant in the Open Era. He won 11 singles titles which tied his 2004 season as the most in over two decades, his 81 match victories were the most since Pete Sampras in 1993, and his record of 81-4 (95.2%) remains the second best winning percentage in the Open Era behind only John McEnroe in 1984.</p>

                  <h4>The GrandSlams</h4>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Federer entered the first Grand Slam of the year on a 21 match winning streak that stretched over a five month period. Federer swept through the first five rounds of the Australian Open without dropping a set, including a quarterfinal straight set win over Andre Agassi. He reached the semifinals in a repeat of the previous year's final, before falling to eventual winner Marat Safin, 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 6-7(6), 7-9. Federer had held a match point at 6-5 in the fourth set tiebreaker and rushed the net, however, Safin responded with a lob; Federer rushed back to retrieve the ball and hit an aggressive between-the-legs trick shot which failed to clear the net. Safin went onto win the tiebreaker and the 80 minute fifth set.</p>
                  <p>Federer, for the first time, entered the French Open with a chance to become only the sixth man to win the Career Grand Slam. He flew through the first five rounds without the loss of a set to reach his first semifinal in Paris. There he met clay specialist Rafael Nadal who had dominated the dirt courts in 2005 with titles in Costa do SauÃ­pe, Acapulco, Monte-Carlo, Barcelona, and Rome. The match did not start until 6:20 PM local time. They split the first two sets with Nadal breaking in the last game of the third set to seize the two sets to one lead. Due to the late start time darkness began to fall in the fourth set and Federer requested for the match to be suspended until the next day. They played on in the near darkness, however, and Nadal broke in the eight game of the set and served out the match. One positive Federer took from the match was that he now believed he had the game to someday win the clay Grand Slam. Additionally the crowds in Paris had taken a great liking to Federer's stylish and flamboyant style of play giving him enormous support and encouragement throughout the tournament; none more so than against Nadal who the Parisian crowds had nicknamed him "l'Ogre" for what they deemed to be his ugly and unstylish grinding manner of play, as well as his loud obnoxious grunting after every shot.</p>
                  <p>Federer entered Wimbledon as the overwhelming favorite with a 29 match winning streak on grass which spanned back to 2003. Federer glided into the semifinals where he faced world number 2 and former WImbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt. Although they were the top two players in the world, the special grass seedings of Wimbledon elevated Andy Roddick as the second seed over Hewitt. This created the strange and rare circumstance of the world's top 2 players meeting before a tournament final. Federer defeated Hewitt in straight sets and advanced to the final where Andy Roddick awaited a rematch of the previous year's final. For a third consecutive year Federer defeated Roddick at the All-England Club and notched his third consecutive Wimbledon corwn with a clear 6-2, 7-6(2), 6-4 victory. This marked Federer's fifth Grand Slam championship and remarkably his first of the season. He also became only the third man in the Open Era to win three consecutive Wimbledon Championships along with Bjorn Borg (1976-78) and Pete Sampras (1993-95 and 1997-99).</p>
                  <p>Federer arrived in New York and once again found himself in another Grand Slam semifinal. By making the semis of all four Grand Slams that year he became only the fourth man to accomplish the feat in the Open Era along with Rod Laver, Ivan Lendl and his coach Tony Roche. He dismissed Hewitt once again in the semifinals, this time in four sets. In the finals he faced American legend and 8 time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi. Federer stated prior to the final that playing Agassi in New York in the finals of the US Open would be "the highlight of my career." Celebrities such as Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Lance Armstrong and Donald Trump flocked to Arthur Ashe Stadium to witness a historic generation clash of tennis superstars. The final was played on the fourth anniversary of 9/11 and patriotic fervor was in the air; it would be one of the last matches in Federer's career where the New York crowd would be pulling for his opponent. They split the first two sets and Agassi lead 4-2 in the third set before Federer leveled and the match went to a pivotal third set tiebreaker. Federer elevated his game and won the final six points of the set to capture the tiebreaker 7-1. Federer then rolled through the fourth set to capture his second championship at the US Open. Agassi praised Federer after match saying, "Pete (Sampras) was great, no question, but there was a place to get to with Pete. It could be on your terms. There's no such place with Roger. I think he's the best I've played against." With his 6th Grand Slam championship Federer equaled his childhood idols Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker. He became only the third man to win both Wimbledon and the US Open for two consecutive years, along with Bill Tilden (1920-21) and Don Budge (1937-38). He also became the first man in 72 years to win his first six Grand Slam finals. Federer appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman who asked him the question many where beginning to wonder: was Sampras' all-time record of 14 Grand Slams, set only three years before, starting to look approachable?</p>

            <h3>2006 : Career Best Season</h3>
            <hr>
            <div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left:0px">
              <p>Roger Federer reached all four Grand Slam finals in 2006, winning three of them. His only Grand Slam loss came against Rafael Nadal in the French Open final in four sets, 6-1, 1-6, 4-6, 6-7(4). This was the first time they had met in a Major final. In the other three Grand Slams of 2006, Federer defeated Nadal in the final of the Wimbledon Championships, 6-0, 7-6(5), 6-7(2), 6-3. He defeated Marcos Baghdatis, 5-7, 7-5, 6-0, 6-2, at the Australian Open and Andy Roddick, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-1, at the US Open. In addition, Federer made it to six ATP Masters Series 1000 finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Also, Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo, three ATP 250 series events in Doha, Halle, and Basel, and captured the Year-End Championships for the third time in his career. In December 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as the second greatest season of all-time during the open era; behind only Rod Laver's Calendar Grand Slam year of 1969.</p>
              <p>Federer won three of the four Grand Slam singles tournaments for the second time and ended the year ranked world No. 1, with his points total being several thousand ahead of world No. 2 Nadal.</p>
              <p>Federer won 12 titles in 2006, which included three Grand Slam titles, four ATP Masters titles, and the Tennis Masters Cup. During the year, he lost to only two players, Nadal in the French Open, Rome, Monte Carlo, and Dubai finals; and Andy Murray in the second round of the Masters Series tournament in Cincinnati. The Cincinnati loss to Murray was Federer's only straight-set loss of the year and the only tournament out of 17 in which he did not reach the final. His win-loss record for the 2006 season was 92-5, falling slightly behind Federer's 2005 season of 81-4.</p>

                <h4>The GrandSlams and Masters Cup</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>After traveling down under, Federer won the year's first Grand Slam tournament, the Australian Open, by defeating Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in four sets. This was Federer's seventh consecutive victory in a Grand Slam final (2003 Wimbledon - 2006 Australian Open), a record to start a career, and second overall only to Pete Sampras's eight consecutive wins (1995 Wimbledon - 2000 Wimbledon). This was Federer's 7th Grand Slam title which tied him for sixth place in the open era with John McEnroe and Mats Wilander.</p>
                <p>Federer only dropped 2 sets en route to making his first French Open final of his career. He met the reigning champion Rafael Nadal in the final. Federer had gone undefeated in 2006 except against Nadal compiling a 44-3 record heading into the finals. He got off to a fast start winning the first set decisively 6-1. The relentless nature of Nadal's play, constantly hitting high bouncing shots to Federer's one-handed backhand, proved a devastating formula. Federer eventually lost the match in a fourth set tiebreaker 6-1, 1-6, 4-6, 6-7(4). This ended many predictions of Federer winning the calendar year Grand Slam in 2006. Although the French Open title eluded him, Federer became one of only two active players who had reached the finals of all four Grand Slam singles tournaments, the other being Andre Agassi.</p>
                <p>Federer entered Wimbledon as the top seed, trying to become the first man since Pete Sampras (1997-2000) to win Wimbledon in four consecutive years. Federer raced through the tournament without dropping a set and met his arch-rival Rafael Nadal in the finals. Federer had not defeated Nadal all season going 0-4 against Nadal but 55-4 overall heading into the final. Federer again thrashed Nadal in the first set, the same way he had in the opening set at Roland Garros, bageling the Spaniard 6-0. The second set was much closer with Federer taking the tiebreaker 7-5. Federer surrendered his first set of the tournament when he lost the third set in a tiebreaker 2-7. In the fourth set Federer reasserted his superior grass court play and took it by a score of 6-3. Federer won the final 6-0, 7-6(5), 6-7(2), 6-3. This was his fourth Wimbledon title and his 8th Grand Slam title of his career. With this Major title win he tied Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors, and Ivan Lendl for sixth on the all-time Grand Slam list behind Bill Tilden (10) Rod Laver (11) Bjorn Borg (11) Roy Emerson (12) and Pete Sampras (14). After Wimbledon, Federer set his sights on winning the US Open.</p>
                <p>During the US Open, the year's last Grand Slam tournament, he defeated American Andy Roddick in four sets 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 for his third consecutive title at Flushing Meadows. During the open era, 2006 is the only year in which the same man (Federer) and woman (Justine Henin) reached the finals of all four Grand Slams. This was Federer's 9th Grand Slam title which put him solely in third place on the all-time Grand Slam list.</p>
                <p>At the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, Federer defeated defending champion David Nalbandian in one of his three round-robin matches. He also scored his second victory of the year over rival Rafael Nadal 6-4, 7-5 in a thrilling semifinal matchup of the top 2 players in the world. Federer then defeated American James Blake, 6-0, 6-3, 6-4, in the finals to win his third Masters Cup title.</p>

            <h3>2007 : Holding off Young Rivals</h3>
            <hr>
            <div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left:0px">
              <p>Roger Federer made all four Grand Slam finals in 2007, winning three of them. He defeated Fernando GonzÃ¡lez, 7-6(2), 6-4, 6-4, in the Australian Open final, Rafael Nadal, 7-6(7), 4-6, 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-2, in the final at Wimbledon, and Novak Djokovic, 7-6(4), 7-6(2), 6-4, at the US Open. However, Federer lost the 2007 French Open final to Nadal, 3-6, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6. Federer made five ATP Masters Series 1000 Finals in 2007, but only won two of those, in Hamburg and Cincinnati. Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Dubai and ended the year by winning the year-end championships for the fourth time. In December 2011 Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2007 season as the sixth greatest season of all-time during the open era.</p>
              <p>Federer finished the year as the world no. 1 player for the fourth consecutive time, compiling an impressive 68-9 record. Due to his performance on the court and off-court personality, in 2007, Time magazine named him as one of the 100 most important persons in the world. Rod Laver, one of the greatest player ever himself described him as follows: "One thing is for sure: he's the best player of his time and one of the most admirable champions on the planet. That's certainly something worth crowing over. The beauty is, Roger Federer won't.".</p>

                <h4>The GrandSlams and Masters Cup</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>Federer entered the Australian Open with a 29 match winning streak dating back to 2006 US Open. In the fourth round Federer faced future world no. 1 and multi-slam winner Novak Djokovic for the first time in a major, defeating him in straight sets. In the semifinals Federer faced American Andy Roddick in a highly anticipated rematch of the 2006 US Open final. Federer delivered a masterclass, crushing the American and delivering the most one sided match of their rivalry 6-4, 6-0, 6-2. Federer won his third Australian Open and 10th Grand Slam singles title, defeating Fernando GonzÃ¡lez of Chile in the final. He became the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1980 to win a Grand Slam singles tournament without losing a set. At the end of the tournament Federer's winning streak stood at 36 consecutive matches, besting his previous career best 35 match winning streak in 2005.</p>
                <p>After his victory over Nadal on clay two weeks earlier in Hamburg, speculation started on whether Federer could become the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four major titles simultaneously. Entering Roland Garros he was reigning champion of Wimbledon, the US Open, and the Australian Open and a victory at the French would mark a historical non-calendar year Grand Slam. At the French Open, Federer raced through the tournament, dropping only one set before reaching the final for the second consecutive year. Entering the final Federer had a 27 match winning streak at the majors and was seeking revenge for his 4 set loss to Nadal in the 2006 final. Federer played well in the final, but could not convert on the many opportunities he had to break the Nadal serve. Federer was 0 for 10 on break point chances in the first set, and only 1 for 17 overall. The result was a defeat at the hands of his arch-rival for the second straight year at the French finals, in four sets.</p>
                <p>He, therefore, entered Wimbledon for the first time without having played a warm-up grass-court tournament. Federer, nevertheless, reached the finals of Wimbledon for the fifth time, only dropping one set. The final was a rematch of 2006 as Federer again faced his nemesis Rafael Nadal. The final would prove to be an epic, delivering the first five set final at Wimbledon since 2001. Federer won the first set in a tight tiebreaker which he won 9-7. Nadal responded in the second and took it 6-4, leveling the match at one set apiece. A pivotal third set was decided by another tiebreaker which Federer claimed 7-3. After the first three sets Federer was only one set away from his fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship. Nadal, however, refused to go down quietly and took the fourth set decisively by a score of 6-2. As they entered the ultimate fifth set both players knew the value of a single break. Federer faced two early fifth set crises when he found himself down double break point in the third and fifth games. Federer, however, saved all four break points to take a 3-2 lead. In the sixth game Federer finally broke the Nadal serve and closed out the championship 6-2 in the final set. This match marked the first time in Federer's career that he was pushed to a fifth set in the finals of a Slam and remained his only five set final victory at a major until 2009 Wimbledon. With this victory Federer tied Bjorn Borg's open-era men's record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles. He also tied Rod Laver and Borg Borg with 11 Grand Slam titles, moving into third place all-time.</p>
                <p>As the winner of U.S. Open Series, Federer had never entered the US Open in a stronger position. Federer lost the opening set in his third and fourth round matches before recovering to defeat John Isner and Feliciano LÃ³pez respectively. His quarterfinal match was especially compelling since it was a rematch of the 2006 final against Andy Roddick. Federer defeated Roddick in straight sets in a match that featured two tiebreakers. Federer reached the finals and faced rising star and world no. 3 Novak Djokovic who had defeated Federer just a few weeks prior in the finals of Montreal. Djokovic started the match hot and quickly found himself at triple set point on his own serve. Federer saved all set points and snatched the first set in a close tiebreaker (it was an exact reversal of the first set just weeks before in Montreal). Djokovic would not yield, however, and again took Federer to a tiebreaker in the second set. Federer again prevailed in the tiebreaker and capitalized on this by taking a close third set as well. Federer's victory over the third seed Djokovic delivered his 12th Grand Slam singles title, and fourth consecutive US Open title. This victory moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of Grand Slam champions. As champion of the US Open Series points race, Federer received a bonus of $1 million, in addition to the $1.4 million prize for winning the US Open singles title. He became the only player in history to win three Grand Slams in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007). Throughout the tournament the American press labeled him Darth Federer for his all-black attire and the tournament played The Imperial March from Star Wars when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches. The Imperial March was also played by the tournament officials after the final match point, in honor of Federer's achievement.</p>
                <p>Federer then finished the season at the year-end Tennis Masters Cup. Despite losing for the first time in the round-robin group to Fernando GonzÃ¡lez, he regrouped against Roddick and Davydenko to advance. Federer went on to defeat Nadal in the semifinals and David Ferrer in the tournament finals to win his fourth Tennis Masters Cup title, finishing the season in style.</p>

            <div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left:0px">
              <p>Roger Federer won one slam in 2008, which came at the 2008 US Open, defeating Briton Andy Murray, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2. Federer was defeated by Rafael Nadal in two Grand Slam finals: at the 2008 French Open, which he lost 1-6, 3-6, 0-6, and at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships in a five-setter, 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 7-9, when he was going for six straight wins to break Bjorn Borg's record. At the 2008 Australian Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic, ending his record of 10 consecutive Major finals.  Later in the year, it was found Federer had been suffering from mononucleosis at the start of the year, particularly during the Australian Open. Roger Federer lost twice in Master Series 1000 Finals on clay to Nadal at Monte Carlo and Hamburg. However, Federer was able to capture three more victories in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.</p>
              <p>In doubles, Federer and compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka won the gold medal in at the 2008 Summer Olympics.</p>

                <h4>The GrandSlams</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>At Wimbledon, Federer once again played world no. 2 Nadal in the final. A victory for Federer would have meant his sixth consecutive Wimbledon singles title, breaking Borg's modern era menâs record and equaling the all-time record held since 1886 by William Renshaw. Federer saved two championship points in the fourth set tiebreak, but eventually lost the match, 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 7-9. The rain-delayed match ended in near darkness after 4 hours, 48 minutes of play, making it the longest (in terms of elapsed time) men's final in Wimbledon recorded history. It concluded 7 hours, 15 minutes after its scheduled start. The defeat also ended Federer's 65-match winning streak on grass. John McEnroe described the match as "The greatest match I've ever seen." After Nadal surpassed him as world no. 1 later in the year, Federer stated that his main goal would be to regain the Wimbledon title, rather than the top spot.</p>
                <p>At the US Open, Federer reached the fourth round without dropping a set. He defeated third-seeded Novak Djokovic in a rematch of the 2007 US Open Final, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2, in the semifinals, and then defeated Andy Murray, who was playing in his first Grand Slam final, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2, to win his fifth straight US Open title and 13th career Grand Slam title, leaving him one Grand Slam title from tying Pete Sampras's all-time record of 14. This extended his US Open winning streak to 34 matches. Federer became the first player in tennis history to have five consecutive wins at both Wimbledon and the US Open.</p>

Federer went on to win two other Master Series 1000 tournaments: in Madrid over Rafael Nadal, and in Cincinnati over Novak Djokovic. He lost in one 500 level event final in Basel to Djokovic.

                <h4>The GrandSlams</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>Federer defeated each of his first three opponents in straight sets at the Australian Open. In the fourth round, Federer rallied from two sets down to defeat Tomas Berdych. Federer reached his record 19th consecutive Grand Slam semifinal by defeating eighth-seeded Juan MartÃ­n del Potro in the quarterfinals in only 80 minutes. In his 18th Grand Slam final, Federer was defeated by long-time rival Nadal in their first meeting on a hard court in a Grand Slam tournament. The match lasted over four hours, with Nadal victorious in five sets. Federer broke down in tears during the trophy presentation and struggled to make his runner-up speech. Federer blamed the defeat on a lack of rhythm in his first serve.</p>
                <p>In the 2009 French Open, in a fourth-round encounter, Federer had to come back from two sets to love down to defeat Tommy Haas. He defeated Gael Monfils in the quarterfinals to reach his 20th consecutive Grand Slam semifinal. He reached his fourth straight final in Paris by outlasting del Potro. He won the French Open for the first time by beating Robin Soderling in the final. With this win, Federer equaled Pete Sampras's men's record of 14 Grand Slam titles and Ivan Lendl's record of 19 Grand Slam finals, and also became the sixth man in history to complete a Career Grand Slam. The call by Eurosport on match point was thus: "Federer wins the French Open for the first first time in his career; and in addition must surely be regarded now as the greatest male player of all-time."</p>
                <p>Federer became the highest seed for Wimbledon, after defending champion Nadal withdrew from the tournament due to tendinitis. Federer defeated Lu Yen-hsun in the first round. He moved safely into the third round with a win over Guillermo GarcÃ­a-LÃ³pez. In the third round, Federer defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber. Federer then booked a place in the quarterfinals by defeating Soderling. In the quarterfinals, Federer cruised past Ivo KarloviÄ, to extend his all-time record of consecutive Grand Slam semifinals to 21. In the semifinals, Federer defeated Tommy Haas to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon final, an all-time record. With this win, he also reached his 20th Grand Slam final, surpassing the previous record of 19 set by Lendl. In a match that took 4 hours and 17 minutes to complete, he beat Roddick in the final in the latest chapter of their long, though lopsided rivalry, regaining the world no. 1 spot from Rafael Nadal. The 30 total games in the fifth set was a new Grand Slam record. The match was also the longest men's singles final (in terms of games played) in Grand Slam history, with 77 games played, and the fifth set alone lasted 95 minutes. The match has been called an "instant classic" by ESPN, and received the highest TV ratings in the UK for any Wimbledon final since 2001. With the win, he also became the fourth man in the open era to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year (the "Channel Slam"), following Nadal in 2008, Borg in 1978-1980, and Laver in 1969. He also joined Nadal as the only players to simultaneously hold Grand Slams on clay, grass, and hard court (2008 US Open, 2009 French Open, 2009 Wimbledon).</p>
                <p>Federer began his US Open campaign well with a victory over unseeded Devin Britton. He advanced to the third round with a second-round win over Simon Greul. His third-round match was against Hewitt, against whom he lost his first set of the tournament, but eventually rallied to win the match. After this match, Federer held a 16-7 lead over Hewitt, continuing a fourteen match winning streak against him. Federer next defeated Tommy Robredo to book a quarterfinal berth against Robin Soderling for the third Grand Slam in a row, which he won in four sets after saving a set point in the fourth set. Federer reached his 21st Grand Slam final by defeating fourth seed Novak Djokovic for the third straight year. He triumphed and, in doing so, reached match point by performing a between-the-legs passing shot, which he later described as "...the greatest shot I ever hit in my life." He lost to del Potro in the final in five sets. The loss broke Federer's streak of forty consecutive wins at the US Open. It also marked the first time Federer had lost in a Grand Slam final to an opponent other than Rafael Nadal.</p>

            <h3>2010 : 4th Australian Open and 5th World Tour Finals title</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The year started with a win at the Australian Open, where he defeated Andy Murray in the final and extended the Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles, matching Andre Agassi's record of four Australian Open titles. Since Wimbledon 2005 Federer had made the finals of 18 out of 19 Grand Slam tournaments, an extraordinary period of sustained excellence unparalleled in the Open Era. This tournament, however, would mark the end of his utter dominance at the majors.</p>
            <p>Federer finished the year in strong form winning indoor titles at the Stockholm Open, Swiss Indoors, and the ATP World Tour Finals in London which brought his tally to 66 career titles. Federer won the year-end championships in London by beating rival Rafael Nadal, for his fifth title at the event. He showed much of his old form, beating all contenders except Nadal in straight sets. It remains the only tournament in his career where Federer defeated all fellow members of the Big Four. Since Wimbledon 2010, Federer had a win-loss record of 34-4. Federer finished in the top two for the eighth consecutive season.</p>
            <h3>2011 : Sixth World Tour Finals title</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Federer lost in the SF of AO and US Open to eventual champion Djokovic. He ended Djokovic's 41 match unbeaten run when
              he beat him in 4 sets at the French Open but lost the final to Nadal. He lost Wimbledon in QF to Jo Wilfred Tsonga. </p>
            <p>Federer finished the season on a high note by yet again dominating the indoor season, winning his last three tournaments of the year at the Swiss Indoors, Paris Masters, and ATP World Tour Finals. He ended a 10-month title drought by winning the Swiss Indoors for the fifth time, defeating rising star Kei Nishikori. Federer followed this up with his first Paris Masters title, where he became the first player to reach all nine Masters 1000 finals. In the final of the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals, Federer defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the third consecutive Sunday and, in doing so, claimed a record sixth ATP World Tour Finals title, finishing the year as world no. 3.</p>
            <h3>2012 : Seventh Wimbledon, second Olympic Medal and return to no. 1</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The 2012 season was a return to excellence for Federer. He had his most match wins since 2006 and his highest winning percentage and number of titles won since 2007.</p>
            <p>Federer reached the semifinal of the 2012 Australian Open, setting up a 27th career meeting with Nadal, a match he lost in four tight sets.
              Federer then moved on to the Indian Wells Masters, where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, and John Isner in the final. Federer won the title for a record fourth time, and, in doing so, equalled Rafael Nadal's record of 19 ATP Masters 1000 titles.
            </p>
            <p>Federer went on to compete at the Madrid Masters on the new blue clay surface, where he beat Tomas Berdych in the final, thus regaining the world no. 2 ranking from Rafael Nadal. In the French Open, Federer made the semifinals before losing to Djokovic.</p>
            <p>At Wimbledon, Federer survived an epic five-set thriller in the third round against Julien Benneteau on his way to the semifinals. In his semifinal match-up against world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, Federer earned a record eighth Wimbledon final appearance after dispatching Djokovic in four sets. Federer defeated Andy Murray in four sets in the 2012 Wimbledon final, regaining the world number-one ranking in the process. "It's amazing. It equals me with Pete Sampras, who's my hero. It just feels amazing", Federer said of winning his seventh Wimbledon championship, tying Sampras' Open Era record. By defeating top-ranked Djokovic in the semifinals and winning in the finals, Federer returned to the top spot in the world rankings and, in doing so, broke Sampras' record of 286 weeks atop the list.</p>
            <p>At the summer Olympics, Federer lost in the final to Andy Murray, winning a silver medal for his country</p>
            <p>Federer stayed in the world No.1 ranking long enough to cross the 300 week mark, finishing as No.1 for 302 weeks, a world record.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Federer struggled with back injuries sustained in March and again in July and saw his ranking drop from No. 2 to No. 6. The 2013 season was the first since 1999 in which Federer failed to reach a final in the first four months of the year.</p>
            <p>Federer lost in SF at AO, 2nd round at Wimbledon and 4th round at US Open</p>
            <p>On 27 December 2013, Federer announced that Stefan Edberg was joining his team as co-coach with Severin LÃ¼thi.</p>
            <h3>2014 : Wimbledon runner-up, and Davis Cup glory</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>At Wimbledon Federer reached a record 9th final, but he was defeated by Djokovic in an epic five-set match.</p>
            <p>Federer defeated Spain's David Ferrer in three sets to capture his sixth Cincinnati crown and his 22nd ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, his first since Cincinnati 2012. He then reached the semifinals at the US Open, however lost in straight sets to eventual champion Marin ÄiliÄ. At the Davis Cup semifinals, Federer won both of his singles matches against Italy in straight sets and hence led Switzerland to the final for the first time since 1992.</p>
            <p>Federer then played in Shanghai Masters. He beat Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, ending the Serb's 28-match unbeaten run on Chinese soil. He battled Frenchman Gilles Simon in his second Shanghai final, defeating him in two tiebreak sets and collected the 23rd Masters 1000 title of his career. The victory saw Federer return to world No. 2 for the first time since May 2013. Federer then played the Swiss Indoors in October, where he went on to win a record 6th title and his 82nd ATP men's singles title overall. Federer also reached the finals of the 2014 ATP World Tour Finals to face Djokovic again but withdrew from the final because of another back injury from his semifinal match. Despite his injury, Federer finished the season on a high by defeating Richard Gasquet to clinch the Davis Cup for Switzerland for the first time in its history.</p>
            <h3>2015 : 1,000th career win, Wimbledon and US Open runners-up</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Federer started his season at the Brisbane International. He defeated Milos Raonic in the final, thereby becoming only the third man in the Open Era to have 1000 or more wins, joining Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl, as well as the first man in the Open Era to win at least one title in each of 15 consecutive years.[118] In Dubai, Federer successfully defended his title with a straight sets victory over Novak Djokovic in the final, marking his seventh title at the tournament and, after Wimbledon and Halle, was the third time he had won seven or more titles in a tournament.</p>
